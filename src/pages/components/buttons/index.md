A button triggers an event or action.

<hr />

### Primary

A primary button is used to highlight to the key objective or call to action on a page, form or modal. Primary buttons should only appear once per page. Some pages do not require primary buttons. 

### Muted

Muted buttons often pair with primary buttons to offer secondary action such as 'Cancel' on a confirmation modal.

### Destructive

A destructive button is used to highlight the consequences of an action such as deleting a record or closing an account.
